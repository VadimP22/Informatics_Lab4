The first part takes place over one day, November 27. 26-year-old Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin returns from a sanatorium in Switzerland, where he spent several years undergoing treatment for epilepsy. The prince appears to be a sincere and innocent person, although he is decently versed in relations between people. He goes to Russia to his only remaining relatives - the Yepanchins family. On the train, he meets a young merchant Parfyon Rogozhin and a retired official Lebedev, to whom he guilelessly tells his story. In response, he learns the details of the life of Rogozhin, who is in love with Nastasya Filippovna, the former kept woman of the wealthy nobleman Afanasy Ivanovich Totsky.

In the Epanchins' house, it turns out that Nastasya Filippovna is well known there. There is a plan to hand her over to General Yepanchin's protege Gavrila Ardalionovich Ivolgin, an ambitious but mediocre man. Prince Myshkin meets all the main characters of the story. These are the daughters of the Epanchins - Alexandra, Adelaide and Aglaya, whom he makes a favorable impression on, remaining the object of their slightly mocking attention. This is General Lizaveta Prokofievna Epanchina, who is in constant excitement due to the fact that her husband communicates with Nastasya Filippovna, who has a reputation for being fallen. This is Ganya Ivolgin, who suffers greatly because of the upcoming role of Nastasya Filippovna's husband, although he is ready for anything for the sake of money, and cannot decide to develop his still very weak relationship with Aglaya. Prince Myshkin quite innocently tells the general's wife and sisters Epanchins that he learned about Nastasya Filippovna from Rogozhin, and also amazes them with his narrative about the memories and feelings of his acquaintance, who was sentenced to death, but was pardoned at the last moment.
